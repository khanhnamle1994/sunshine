 * SettingsActivity is responsible for displaying the {@link SettingsFragment}. It is also

 * button is clicked from the SettingsActivity, we want to navigate to the Activity that the user
 * came from to get to the SettingsActivity.
 * <p>
 * For example, when the user is in the DetailActivity and clicks the settings option in the menu,
 * and then clicks the up button, we want to navigate back to the DetailActivity. If the user
 * navigates to the SettingsActivity from the MainActivity, then we want to navigate back to the
 * MainActivity when the user clicks the up button from the SettingsActivity.
